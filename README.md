# hello-world
Yep, you've found another repository! Congrats!

Well, I feel obliged to inroduce myself, my name is Paul D. Zinn, Jr., and , yes, I nearly ALWAYS write it out fully like that. It is who I am after all.

Of course, the specific purpose for me creating this repository is so that I can learn the ways of Github.

Now for a little more about myself.

I am quite a noob to coding, but, I am hungry to learn. 
I am the business owner and operaitor for a creative marketing firm:

Also if you would like to learn more about me personally and find out some of my creative nunchuck skills, check out my portfolio:

Here are some more specific reasons behind why I am begining this journey into the Github community:
-- Collaberation!
---- It has been said before "you cannot change the world, but we can". That is a hard thing to hear for our walt disney generation. But, it is indeed REAL TALK! Tell me I am wrong. If we are going to achive great things we can do some of them ourselves, but if we REALLY want to attack the BIG problems that the world has, we are going to have to learn the language of "WE" in stead of "Me"
-- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Etc...
---- Something that is truly facianiting to me is the prospect of both; exploring the bridge to the gap between the digital world and physical world, and also to help to make that bridge wider. 
-- Software Automation & Augmentation.
---- I am growing weary of the limitions that my GUI software has. I am hungry to learn how to push the envelope of what I can accomplish in them through things like XML, XMP, Scripts, Web Apps, and anything else that han help me improve & expand my creative gifting into the world of code, scripts, and app development.
-- Video Editing App/tool development
---- I do alot of work with and loose alot of hair while video editing. It is out of these trying seasons of work that I am sparked with ideas to help make my life easier... and hopefully, these ideas can help to make the lives of others easier too! 

Other "fun facts"
--I love people... people are THE BEST!
--I love investing in the lives of children. Children are the most important kind of people.
--I love creativity.
